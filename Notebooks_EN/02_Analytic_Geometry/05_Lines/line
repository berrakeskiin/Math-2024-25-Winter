## Exercise Solutions

### 1. Find the equation of the line passing through points A(1, 2) and B(3, 4).

#### Python Code:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

A = (1, 2)
B = (3, 4)

x1, y1 = A
x2, y2 = B
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
x, y = symbols('x y')
equation = Eq(y - y1, m * (x - x1))
line_equation = solve(equation, y)[0]

print(f"The equation of the line passing through points {A} and {B} is: y = {line_equation}")
